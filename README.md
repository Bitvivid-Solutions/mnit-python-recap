## README

This project combines all the important concepts so far, like conditionals, loops, OOPS etc, into a problem of attendance sheet maintenance for employees and students alike.
It demonstrates creation of some sorting function which will exercise understanding of working with conditionals and list.

## TODO
Consider this as a reference for yourself and try to implement your own "attendance book", "student" and "employee" classes and see how you can implement them on your own.
